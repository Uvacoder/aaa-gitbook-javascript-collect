| [.replace\(\)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace) | The **`replace()`** method returns a new string with some or all matches of a `pattern` replaced by a `replacement`. The `pattern` can be a string or a [`RegExp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp), and the `replacement` can be a string or a function to be called for each match. If `pattern` is a string, only the first occurrence will be replaced. |

“A newline character is written like "\n".”
