| [IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) | The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's viewport. |

| [event.currentTarget\(\)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/currentTarget) | The **`currentTarget`** read-only property of the [`Event`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) interface identifies the current target for the event, as the event traverses the DOM. It always refers to the element to which the event handler has been attached, as opposed to [`Event.target`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/target), which identifies the element on which the event occurred and which may be its descendant. |
