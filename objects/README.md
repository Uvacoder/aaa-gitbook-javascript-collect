| [constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/constructor) | The constructor property returns a reference to the Object constructor function that created the instance object. Note that the value of this property is a reference to the function itself, not a string containing the function's name. The value is only read-only for primitive values such as 1, true and "test". |
| [properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object#Properties_of_the_Object_constructor) | **JavaScript Properties**. **Properties** are the values associated with a **JavaScript** object. A **JavaScript** object is a collection of unordered **properties**. **Properties** can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only. |
