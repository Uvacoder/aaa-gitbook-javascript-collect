# Closure

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| iterators |  |
| maintain state in async |  |
| memoize | an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. |
| partial application |  |
| scope | the rules in any programming language for any given line of code, what data do i have available to me |

{% hint style="info" %}
COVE - closed over variable environment
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
PLSRD - persistant, lexical or static, scoped, referenced, data

backpack = closure = \[\[scope\]\] = hidden data
{% endhint %}

### Closure gives our functions persistent memories and entirely new toolkit for writing professional code

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| helper functions | everyday professional helper functions like `once` and `memoize` |
| iterators and generators | which use lexical scoping and closure to achieve the most contemporary patterns for handling data in javascript |
| module pattern | preserve state for the life of an application without polluting the gobal namespace |
| asynchronous javascript | callbacks and promises rely on closure to persist state in an asynchronous environment |
