## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1 - Node.js: [Installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) . OS X and Linux users should install Node.js via the
[Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (NVM). NVM makes it easy to switch between installed Node.js versions and allows installation of global modules without super-user privileges.

2 - Yarn: [Installation](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

3 - Webpack: [Installation](https://webpack.js.org/guides/installation/)

NOTE: If you have errors installing webpack with

$ npm install --save-dev Webpack

use:

$ npm install -g webpack
