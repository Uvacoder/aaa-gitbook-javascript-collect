| [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) | The read-only **`localStorage`** property allows you to access a [`Storage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage) object for the [`Document`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document)'s origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions. `localStorage` is similar to [`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage), except that while data stored in `localStorage` has no expiration time, data stored in `sessionStorage` gets cleared when the page session ends â€” that is, when the page is closed. |
| [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) | The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources \(including across the network\). It will seem familiar to anyone who has used [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest), but the new API provides a more powerful and flexible feature set. |
