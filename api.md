| [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) | The read-only **`localStorage`** property allows you to access a [`Storage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage) object for the [`Document`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document)'s origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions. `localStorage` is similar to [`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage), except that while data stored in `localStorage` has no expiration time, data stored in `sessionStorage` gets cleared when the page session ends â€” that is, when the page is closed. |
